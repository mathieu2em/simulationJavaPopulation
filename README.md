# simulationJavaPopulation
simulation in java of a population with deaths and birth and genealogical tree

we were asked to create a population simulator working with Gompertz-Makeham law.

we had to use a heap structure
and to be able to choose how many time should the simulation time be.

coded it in 2 days.

the binder contains two graphs made with GNUplot from the datas of 2 simulations
